# `robustica`

Manuscript repository.

We use robustica to compute robust ICA using TCGA data on breast cancer.

## Compare clustering methods
Compare how different clustering methods perform to compute robust ICA.

## Benchmark
Evaluate how `robustica` performs compared to available tools to compute robust ICA:
- `MineICA` in R
